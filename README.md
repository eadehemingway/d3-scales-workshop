# scales workshop

### step one

write all your code in `App.js`. The first task is to write the x and y scale. you will complete the calculateXScale and calculateYScale functions.

### step two

in componentDidMount draw a rectangle for each bit of data make the height equal to the num - use the scales to make sure it all fits!

### step three

the add and remove buttons currently add/remove an item of data from the data array. Now we need to write the redraw function so that this is reflected in the graph.
